# PicoBricks Game
## The aim of the game is to throw modules into projects related to the modules on Picobricks.

### Game Features and Rules
* There are four tracks and four shooting areas in the game.
* When the player shoots at the wrong project with the module, he/she loses one life.
* The player has 12 lives in total.
* The player can not move on to other tracks without throwing the modules into the correct projects in the tracks. This process was applied to each track.
